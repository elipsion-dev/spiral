Spiral Challenge - draw a spiral in the web browser

We were challenged to write a program which could draw a spiral in the web browser. I did not have access to the internet to look anything up. Once I got the math right and worked out drawing one spiral I took the project further to see if I could draw double and triple and random # spirals. 

This challenge led me to envision and work on my next project - I wanted to see if I could draw Epicycloids and Hypocycloids in the web browser. The math to draw these shapes is a bit harder than just spirals and I wanted the user to be able to pick their own cusp rate. I will upload that project in a separate repository.
